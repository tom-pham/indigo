# Background
In 2018, I worked for the **Portland Parks & Recreation** in the Urban Forestry
division as a **GIS Intern** while simultaneously getting my GIS Certificate at 
the Portland Community College. During this time, I analyzed 30 years of tree planting data to assess whether or not the City of Portland had been equitably extending forest resources to low income and low canopy neighborhoods.
