# The Gist
For Valentine's day I decided to use my interest in spatial data to come up with
something creative for my girlfriend. I knew I wanted to make a map of some sort
of places we've been together. At first I thought of making a static map but
then I remembered a [blog post](https://blog.mapbox.com/diy-resumap-cef7449e3293)
that showed how to use Mapbox and a little bit of javascript to make a fun fly
through map and turn it into a website hosted on Github (just like this blog).
Check it out [here](https://arielandtom.github.io/) or down below.

# What is Mapbox?
Mapbox is a service that offers online web maps. There is a lot of
opportunity to create stylized and customized basemaps. I recall playing around
with this product back in one of my GIS classes and it was a lot of fun.

# What you need to make the map
- **Mapbox account and an access token**
- **Github account (that you haven't used to host a page yet)**
- **Spatial data (lat/longs)**
- **(Optional) Photos**


## Step 1. Get a Mapbox account
First create a [Mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) it's 
free! The only caveat being that with a free account you'll only be given a 
limited number of tile requests. For a small project like this, it's probably
fine but just be aware of that. You can see the full limitations of what a free
account will get you [here](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing).

## Step 2. Get your Mapbox access token
Once your account is created you'll need your access token to request tiles
for your webmap. Go to your [account](https://account.mapbox.com/), click 
**create access token**. 

## Step 3. Create a Github account
Github allows you to create a website for free that will look
like `username.github.io`. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart). 
The quick and dirty of it all is that once you set up a repo that follows the
convention `username.github.io`, you can create a page that will be hosted
by Github!

## Step 4. Collect your spatial data
All you need to create this map are a series of latitudes and longitudes in
decimal degrees. For this project, I went through my photos and figured out
which locations I wanted to display. I decided on our first couple of dates
and vacations we've been on together. I collected the locations in a spreadsheet,
and then got the latitude and longitudes. Google Photos has a feature that 
shows you where a photo was taken with a link to Google Maps if the photo
was geotagged. Luckily most of mine were, so I simply followed the link and 
got the coordinates. Maybe as a follow up post I'll think of a way to 
programatically extract the coordinates from the EXIF data.

## Step 5. Create your site!
Use this [template](https://gist.github.com/brynnehenn/bcb127f54ea345aae6cef1106ce65b90#file-resumap-html) 
to create your map! 


At its most simplest, all
you need to do is:

- Add your own Mapbox access token
- Create your sections that can include text, photos, etc
- Set your section's location, zoom level, pitch


### Add access token
Navigate to the section where you can enter you token
```javascript 
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'PASTE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE';
```

### Add section content
Next add headers, text, and photos for a section that you want to create. This
is what the html looks like and what the output looks like. Very simple html
here. All I've done is add a couple of headers, a paragraph, and and image. One
thing to note is that this is encapsulated by the `section id` which I've labeled
as **tonys**. Each section id will be used to identify the section and to link
the coordinates, zoom, and pitch for the fly through aspect of this map. 

```html
    <section id='tonys'>
        <h3>Point Reyes National Seashore pt. 1</h3>
        <h4>üìç Tony's Seafood Restaurant </br>üìÖ 12/30/2021</h4>
        <p>
            Our most recent vacation was at Point Reyes National Seashore. We spent the end of 2021 together at a quaint
            inn (and stables üêé). It was a lovely getaway for the two of us to just relax and enjoy this beautiful area. 
            In all, we actually got to see quite a bit of the entire park. The trip began at Tony's Seafood Restaurant,
            where we celebrated free oyster ü¶™ day. Those BBQ oysters are bomb dot com. It was just a perfect trip 
            enjoying what we love to do - see nature, eat good food, and spend time together üíñ.

    </section>
```

### Add location data
Further down below you'll see the `script` section. This is where the Mapbox
map is initiated and where we will define some key aspects of our fly through
sections. 

```javascript
'tonys': {
        bearing: -0,
        center: [-122.8832,38.1469],
        zoom: 16,
        speed: 0.8,
        pitch: 0
    }
```
This bit of javascript controls the 'camera options' of the fly through animation
for this specific section. You can read about these options in detail 
[here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/properties/#cameraoptions), but
I'll give a quick description for the options listed here.
- **bearing**: the compass direction (in degrees) that is up
- **center**: the center of your map given in latitude/longitude (decimal degrees)
- **zoom**: the zoom level of your map (higher = more zoomed in)
- **speed**: the speed at which the map will 'fly' to the location
- **pitch**: the angle towards the horizon (in degrees)
