### Background
Previously, I worked as research associate for the University of California
Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries. There, I conducted research with a team
investigating survival and movement patterns of endangered and threatened salmon
in California. We did this by taking juvenile salmon and surgically implanting
them with acoustic tags that emit a unique signal. As the fish were released 
back into the the river, we were able to track their movement and survival via
receivers
