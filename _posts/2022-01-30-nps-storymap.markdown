# Background
In 2018 I worked with the National Park Service for the South Florida Carribean
Inventory and Monitoring Network. There I took on a project analyzing aerial
photos of nesting birds in Biscayne National Park. I developed a methodology
to assess success of nests for great blue and great white herons. I created
an ArcGIS Online Story Map to document my research, and I also investigated
the efficacy of drone acquired imagery for future studies.
