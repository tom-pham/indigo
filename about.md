Hi :wave:!

My name is Tom Pham, and I'm a data analyst at the Institute of Health Metrics
and evaluation. I work on the COVID-19 forecasting team, where I deliver
modeled forecasting results through an [online viz tool](https://covid19.healthdata.org/global) 
as well as policy briefing documents for hundreds of locations throughout the world
to help policy makers make informed decisions.
